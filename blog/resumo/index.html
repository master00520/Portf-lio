    <h3>This Monday (22), Apple held its annual developer conference, WWDC 2020. For the first time, the event took place in a virtual environment due to the pandemic of the new coronavirus.iOS 14
    Contrary to what some rumors suggested, the new operating system will be iOS 14, not iPhoneOS 14. The company has detailed OS news, and a lot reminds us of Android.
    
    App Library
    Apple also announced the so-called App Library, a feature that automatically organizes applications into groups to reduce the number of pages on the system.
    
    Widgets
    The widgets finally made it to the iOS home screen. They come in different sizes, customized for each user.
    
    Siri full of news
    The personal assistant Siri now has support for sending audio messages and has also had an improvement in the translation system, which will work offline in several languages.
    
    posts
    Group messaging now has better notification options and more organized replies. It will also be possible to pin the most important conversations and use new Memoji options.
    
    CarKey
    A very interesting new feature of iOS 14 is CarKey, which allows you to use the iPhone to open your car. The feature works through NFC and the first vehicle that will support CarKey will be the BMW 5 Series 2021.
    
    iPadOS 14
    Apple also announced iPadOS 14, a new version of its operating system developed especially for the iPad. The update brings changes to the design of some applications, such as Photos, Music and Calendar. Siri news also arrives here, while phone call notifications appear compressed at the top of the screen.
    
    It will now also be possible to convert a handwritten reminder into digital text automatically (hello, Galaxy Note).
    
    Space audio for AirPods Pro
    Another novelty announced by Apple during WWDC 2020 was the arrival of a "space audio" feature that brings three-dimensional sound to AirPods Pro. The novelty will come through a firmware update on Apple's wireless headphones.
    
    watchOS 7
    Finally, Apple's smart watch will receive an update with sleep monitoring feature. The Apple Watch will also help the user to wash their hands properly, for the time recommended by healthcare organizations.
    
    Smart home
    The iOS interface has been optimized to make life easier for those with a connected home. Categories such as cameras and light receive their own applications.</h3></div>
